Assignment 1: Interpreter and Compiler

Status of Programs:
All of the programs and functionality is working.  I am currently
in the process of looking everything over and maybe refactoring some
things, but it all appears to at least pass all of the tests.

Experience and Lessons:
Most of the issues that I encountered were mostly about me not quite
knowing what I was doing as opposed to some logical turn taking.
With getting the idea from the study group I am in to use a unwrapper 
function helped a lot for the interpreter making it easily into a sort
of functional programming style.
The second half for the compiler, it was a little tricky just getting
all of the list to work and connect alright.  But once I did and I figured
out the calls that I'm able to call, it became real easy getting that
stack logic going. Not turned out to be one of the trickiest ones.
So then, last minute, was chatting about the assignment and came to the 
realization that for the xor function was compiling twice still, so
changed up the function and resubmitted.
